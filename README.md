# Noghal

Welcome in the world of Noghal! Noghal is a planet rich of fantastic creatures and sizzling magic. The technology, the people use there, is based on magic crystals - the Tar'Nogh stones -, which are mined by the dwarves deep in the crystal mountains. The species of the humans, the elves, the dwarves, the lizard-like Krunark and the plant-like Xylanths have get together to a peaceful coexistence.

But dark shadows lurk on the horizon of destiny! Sinister demonic powers are returning to this world! They are allied with some ancient inhabitants of Noghal, who left the planet millennia ago. These inhabitants are technologically far advanced and now return from their exodus to put their feet back onto Noghal again.
